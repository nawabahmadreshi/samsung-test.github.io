      <td>EDC (Edje Data Collection) file is a text script file that contains the code describing the position, size, and other parameters of graphical elements that compose the visual aspect of the Tizen native application. Using the Edje library tools, an EDC file must be compiled into a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.edj</code> file, which is a UI layout binary.</td>

The format of the WGT package is based on the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) widgets standard.Related terms: <a href="#Web_application">Web application</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Access token</td>
      <td>Security credentials for a login session. They identify the user, the user’s groups and privileges, and, in some cases, a particular application.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Actor (in DALi)</td>
      <td>Primary object that composes the entire scene and interacts in DALi applications. Actors are effective nodes that receive input (such as touch events) and act as a container for drawable elements and other actors. A DALi application uses a hierarchy of actor objects to position visible content. An actor inherits a position relative to its parent, and can be moved relative to this point. UI components can be built by combining multiple actors.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Author certificate</td>
      <td>Developer signs an application package with their author certificate and signing key to specify who developed the application. The result of the signing is an author signature.Related terms: <a href="#Tizen_certificate">Tizen certificate</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Author signature</td>
      <td>Author signature specifies which entity alleges to have authored the package, that the integrity of the package is as the author intended, and whether a set of packages came from the same author.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cairo</td>
      <td>Open source library for 2D vector graphics with support for multiple output devices. In Tizen, Cairo can support output to 2 different backends: the image and GL backend.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>config.xml</td>
      <td>File that contains the Web application package information. It defines all the information about the package and applications in it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DALi</td>
      <td>DALi (Dynamic Animation Library) is a cross-platform 3D UI toolkit for embedded systems. Its 3D user interface engine enables you to create rich and high-performance UI applications. DALi is based on OpenGL ES 2.0, but provides a clean cross-platform C++ framework. This means that you can use high-level DALi APIs instead of accessing low-level OpenGL APIs directly.Related terms: <a href="#OpenGL_ES">OpenGL ES</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Distributor certificate</td>
      <td>Distributor, such as the Tizen Store, signs an application package with its distributor certificate and signing key to specify who distributes the application. The result of the signing is a distributor signature.Related terms: <a href="#Tizen_certificate">Tizen certificate</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Distributor signature</td>
      <td>Distributor signature specifies that a particular distributor has distributed a package, that the integrity of the package is as the distributor intended, and whether a set of packages came from the same distributor.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DUID</td>
      <td>DUID (Device Unique ID) is assigned to the device by a device vendor. Based on the DUID, a vendor-specific test distributor certificate is generated.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>EFL</td>
      <td>Tizen platform provides EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) as one of the native UI toolkit frameworks for developing a native application. EFL is a collection of libraries that are independent or can build on top of each other to provide useful features that complement the OS’s existing environment, rather than wrap and abstract it, trying to be their own environment and OS in its entirety. This means that EFL expects you to use other system libraries and APIs in conjunction with EFL libraries to provide a whole working application or library. Simply use EFL as a set of convenient pre-made libraries to accomplish many complex or painful tasks.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>EGL</td>
      <td>EGL™ (Embedded-System Graphics Library) is an interface between rendering APIs, such as OpenGL ES, and the underlying native platform window system. It handles graphic context management, surface/buffer binding, and rendering synchronization, and enables high-performance, accelerated, mixed-mode 2D and 3D rendering using other APIs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Elementary UI components</td>
      <td>Elementary library is a set of fast, finger-friendly, scalable, and themeable UI component libraries. It provides several UI components that can be used to compose the user interface of Tizen native applications.Originally, the Elementary was developed as part of the Window manager development on desktop devices. For the mobile and wearable profile, Tizen platform reused the proper UI components and created new ones, and then enhanced the adjusted all of them for Tizen native applications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Elm_GLView</td>
      <td>The easiest way to use the OpenGL ES API in a Tizen application is to rely on the Elm_GLView component. The Elm_GLView component is one of the Elementary UI components, which creates an OpenGL ES (GL) target surface and a context. The Elm_GLView component can be embedded in any Tizen UI application. It is basically a wrapper of Evas_GL, the GL/EGL abstraction layer of EFL. By using the Elm_GLView component, you avoid having to consider how EGL environment is coupled with the native windowing systems.Related terms: <a href="#OpenGL_ES">OpenGL ES</a>, <a href="#Evas">Evas</a>, <a href="#EGL">EGL</a>, <a href="#EFL">EFL</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>EOS</td>
      <td>EOS (End Of Stream) is a condition where no more data can be read from the stream.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Evas</td>
      <td>Canvas engine responsible for managing the drawing of your content. All graphical objects that you create are Evas objects. Evas handles the entire window state by filling the canvas with objects and manipulating their states. In contrast to other canvas libraries, such as Cairo, OpenGL, and XRender, Evas is not a drawing library, but a scene graph library that retains the state of all objects.The Evas concept is explained in <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/development/ui-practices/native-application/efl/graphical-objects/evas-rendering-concept-and-method?langredirect=1">Evas Rendering Concept and Method.</a> Evas objects are created and then manipulated until they are no longer needed, at which point they are deleted. This allows you to work in the same terms than a designer thinks in: it is a direct mapping, as opposed to having to convert the concepts into drawing commands in the right order, and calculate the minimum drawing calls needed to get the job done.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>EXIF</td>
      <td>EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) is a format used for images, sound, and tags in digital still cameras and other systems handling the image and sound files recorded by digital still cameras.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GDB</td>
      <td>GDB (GNU Debugger) is the most popular debugger for UNIX systems to debug C and C++ programs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Home screen</td>
      <td>Main user interface on a device or operating system where the user can access a set of functions or applications available on the device.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hybrid Web application</td>
      <td>Tizen supports a WGT package that contains 1 Web application and multiple native service or widget applications. When you want to develop a Web application and also use powerful Tizen native APIs, you can develop a Web application and separate native service and widget applications, and package them all to a WGT package.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout</td>
      <td>Container component that takes a standard Edje design file and wraps it very thinly in a UI component. Unlike other container components, which have predefined layouts, the layout component enables you to define the look and feel of the UI with animation and basic event response.</td>

The subject represents the domain of the process, and the object represents the domain of the resource (such as file, process, IPC, or network), which the process tries to access. The access type is the parameter of the operation that the subject wants to perform with the object, for example, read, write, or execute.</td>

For window management purposes, this set of surface objects is to be considered as a single window, and it must also behave as such. The aim of sub-surfaces is to offload some of the compositing work within a window from clients to the compositor. A prime example is a video player with decorations and video in separate surface objects. This allows the compositor to pass YUV video buffer processing to dedicated overlay hardware, when possible.</td>
