# Open Source 

Open source software stack created for a wide array of devices with different form factors. The primary objectives of Tizen are to create an open software platform available for carriers, OEMs, and developers to make their innovative ideas a reality, and to introduce a successful, real-world product that improves the mobile experience for users. We have also wanted to make sure there is no central point of failure, where 1 industry player can restrict or control the innovations of another. The result is a full, production-quality consumer product with source code open for customization and porting.

- **Device manufacturers** can begin with 1 of the profiles and modify it to serve their own needs, or use the Tizen Common base to develop a new profile to meet the memory, processing, and power requirements of any device and quickly bring it to market.
- **Mobile operators** can work with device partners to customize the operating system and user experience to meet the needs of specific customer segments or demographics.
- **Application developers and ISVs** can take advantage of the power of native application development with the flexibility of unparalleled HTML5 support. Tizen also offers the potential for application developers to extend their reach to new "smart devices" running Linux, including wearables, consumer electronics (such as TVs, gaming consoles, and DVRs), cars, and appliances.

Project is a part of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/) and is governed by a Technical Steering Group, which is the primary decision-making body for the open source project, with a focus on platform development and delivery, along with the formation of working groups to support device verticals.

The [Association](http://www.tizenassociation.org/) has been formed to guide the industry role, including gathering of requirements, identification and facilitation of service models, and overall industry marketing and education.

## Get Started

To get started with development:

- Get access

  You can register for an account at [https://www.linux.org/user/register](https://www.linux.org/user/register).

- Study the development workflow

  Linux developers use the Git and [GBS command-line tools](reference/gbs/gbs-overview.md) for most of their work. Source code is managed by [Gerrit](reference/gerrit-usage.md), a code review system for Git-based projects. Source code cloning, development, and review are done under ACL (Access Control Lists). Make sure you have access rights to them.

Start by reading the [Development Workflow](about/work-flow.md) page.
